# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview


## Results

Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
"IS SUCCESSFUL" is our target variable.

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The features are all the others variables that are being used in our model, such as "APPLICATION_TYPE", and "CLASSIFICATION". 

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
In our first attempt we dropped the identification columns "EIN" and "NAME". We removed this columns from the dataset before building our projects

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
